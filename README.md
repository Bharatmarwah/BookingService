# 🎟️ BookingService

> 🚧 **Status: In Progress**

BookingService is a backend microservice responsible for handling seat reservations, booking lifecycle management, and consistency in a microservice-based movie booking system.

This service manages core booking logic including temporary seat locking, booking cancellation, and automatic expiry handling to ensure seats are not blocked due to failed or abandoned bookings.
